# ATM Machine using OOP in Python

## Introduction

Firstly, I focused on understanding the following core concepts:

- Generator functions
- Data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

After grasping these basics, I took some help from this [discussion on Python.org](https://discuss.python.org/t/basic-atm-machine-deposits-withdrawals-using-oop/14150) to build and structure my project.
